    <h3>Footprints in the sand poem.</h3>
    <p>Death comes knocking at odd hours and let&#039;s itself in uninvited. Footprints in the sand is a beautiful christian poem about having faith in god even when times are tough.

Footprints in the sand stay for a minute before the waves lift them away into the unforgiving sea leaving you there wishing that they would stay for a slight moment longer before they are gone forever.</p>
