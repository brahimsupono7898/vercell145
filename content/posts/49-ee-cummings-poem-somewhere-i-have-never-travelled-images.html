    <p><strong>49+ Ee Cummings Poem Somewhere I Have Never Travelled Images</strong>. Your slightest look easily will unclose me though i have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself as spring opens (touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose. Somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond.</p>

                Nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands. Unfortunately this poem has been removed from our archives at the insistence of the copyright holder. Cummings did not give his poems titles, so editors would generally take the first line of his poems to create titles.

    <h3>Cummings from a collection by caroline kennedy on her mother&#039;s favorite poems.</h3>

Your slightest look easily will unclose me though i have closed myself as fingers, you open always petal by petal myself as spring opens (touching skillfully, mysteriously) her first rose. I came across your website by chance googling a favorite ee cummings that i was sending to my partner with whom i just celebrated 20 years together. In your most frail gesture are things which enclose me, or which i cannot touch because they are too near.</p>

        <p>For example, in somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond the title is taken from the first line and is immediately controversial, a small i being used instead of a capital, to signify the self.</p>
