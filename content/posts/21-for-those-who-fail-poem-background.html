                Learn how to write a poem about failing and share it! Poetry of resistance, of history and the dark and hopeful present, political poems, narrative poems, passionate, angry, sometimes very funny, with a the final line of espada&#039;s poem speaks volumes about poetry of the political imagination—be it a sonnet or a film: Eloquent in his celebration of those whose names and faces are &#039;rubbed off / by oblivion&#039;s thumb like a roman.
