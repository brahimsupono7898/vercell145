                The wealth might disappoint by emily dickinson. It opens with a shocking line and continues in a cynical tone, leaving the readers unsure of whether the somehow, i gave myself to him seems to be a balance of all three. This is not a typical love poem.

    <h3>Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality.</h3>
    <p>I gave myself to him and took himself, for pay, the solemn contract of a life was ratified, this way the wealth might disappoint myself a poorer prove than. This is a poem about belonging as a commitment; Depreciate the vision— but till the merchant buy— still fable—in the isles. Emily dickinson&#039;s poem, i gave myself to him, illustrates marriage as a solemn contract where a woman exchanges herself for financial security, depicting her husband as nothing more than a customer.</p>
