                I don&#039;t want to give any more clues, but if i am not too feeble to return to the chest when. As i have gone alone in there and with my treasures bold, i can keep my secret where, and hint of riches new and old. Join a gypsy&#039;s kiss as they tell you about their search for the treasure forrest fenn hid somewhere in the mountains north of santa fe, new mexico in 2010.

    <h3>This poem written by forrest fenn contains nine clues that if followed precisely, will lead to the end of his rainbow and the treasure.</h3>
    <p>He offered clues to its location, hidden in the 24 verses of a poem. Next is the hard part. Fenn has rewritten the poem, but he may just end up entombed with his treasure yet. When fenn said in esquire magazine that the treasure chest belongs to destiny, it&#039;s part of history, those were also clues.</p>
