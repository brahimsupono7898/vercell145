    <h3>You&#039;re a good kid, that&#039;s smart and cool.</h3>
    <p>First grade by william stafford. Even when the sun is still not up i can totally relate to this poem since i&#039;ve been through similar circumstances and i made my very first best friend. For work is always mixed with fun. Poetry about graduation from this graduation poem is poetry about graduation to inspire and encourage the graduate.</p>
